            Hi Everyone, I am <span className="purple">Susilkessav </span>
            from <span className="purple"> India.</span>
            <br />
            I hold a Masterâ€™s in Data Analytics Engineering from Northeastern University.
            <br />
            I have a strong passion for data engineering, robotics, and solving complex real-world problems with machine learning.
            <br />
            <br />
            Besides coding, here are a few activities that I enjoy!
